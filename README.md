This repository contains my progressive implementation of a Ray Tracer in Java, structured across several educational milestones.
The project aims to develop a simple rendering engine capable of:

* Comparing images (Milestone 0)
* Basic classes for vector computation (Milestone 1)
* Reading the scene description file (Milestone 2)
* First images (spheres only) (Milestone 3)
* Computing the color of a point (Milestone 4)
* Adding shadows and Phong illumination (Milestone 5)
* Finalization and bonus features (Milestone 6)
    * -- Adding planes and triangles
    * -- Reflective surfaces

The educational objective is to learn:

* object oriented programming in Java
* unit testing (JUnit 5)
* structuring a Maven project
* image manipulation (Java AWT)
* the architecture of a simple rendering engine
* code organization and Git versioning

Technologies used:

* Java 25
* Maven
* JUnit 5.8.1
* IntelliJ IDEA
* Git / GitHub
